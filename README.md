## Inspiration
- Difficulties faced by  cancer patients to fill **Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM)**
- No user-friendly user interface for filling the survey
- Boring and repetitive questions
- No pause button!
- No storage facility of the data from survey to be reviewed by doctors
- We knew that cancer patients would be very tensed and stress. We wanted to create a positive environment for them, only then they would be able to recover. We didn’t want to give them the hospital feel they experience on a day to day basis. We really really wanted to make them smile and recharge their positive energy


## What it does
- A user-friendly user interface which is very colorful to boost dopamine in patients
- Highlighted import text in each and every sentence with GIF and audio description would be easy for anyone to understand even if they don’t the language
- A soothing music to please the ears of the patients
- Funny GIF and videos for each question to make the patients happy while answering the questions
- Text-To-Speech for reading out the questions to the patients so they can take the survey with ease
- A pause option so the patients can pause the survey and resume at their ease
- A database is integrated with the application for storing the survey entered by the patients to be 
   reviewed later by the doctors 


## How we built it
- We used Adobe XD to create the stunning colorful user interface
- Using dart and Flutter, we created the widgets and made the UI responsive
- We integrated firebase as database  with the application to store the survey details 
- We have added a lot of gifs, videos and music to please the patients who use the application so they 
   don't get bored while filling the survey


## Challenges we ran into
- We had challenge of integrating the asset with the user interface 
- Another challenge we had was integrating the created flutter package with firebase which was 
  eventually solved
- Last but not the least we had the challenge of finding funny gifs and videos to boost the dopamine 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating an user-friendly app for patients to take the survey with ease
- A hope of making patients smile while taking the survey 
- The learnings we did while creating the app 
- Specifically to mention is the team coordination which made all the above happen  


## What we learned
- Major learning was how it was difficult for the cancer patients to take a survey, how they feel lost and 
   why they need a lot of love
- We learned a lot about plug-ins and related applications 
- We also learned about how to integrate 


## What's next for UpLift
- Adding up all the cancer surveys to make the app available for all people
- Integrating it with hospitals and doctors for reviewing the patient details and give online counselling to 
   the patients
- Adding other features like online patient community and online chatting options to make the patients 
  even more comfortable and relaxed while answering the survey
