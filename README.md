Uplift is a mobile application designed to uplift cancer patients by providing a user-friendly interface for filling out Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM). This project was developed during HackZurich 2021.

## Inspiration 
- Difficulties faced by cancer patients in filling Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM).
- Lack of user-friendly interfaces for surveys.
- Boring and repetitive questions in existing solutions.
- Absence of data storage facilities for doctors to review survey results.

## What It Does 
- Provides a colorful and user-friendly interface to boost dopamine levels in patients.
- Includes soothing music to please the patients.
- Displays funny videos for each question to keep patients entertained.
- Utilizes Text-To-Speech for reading out questions, making the survey accessible.
- Allows patients to pause and resume the survey at their convenience.
- Integrates a database to store survey responses for later review by doctors.
